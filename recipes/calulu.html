    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Codfish fillets, cut into large bite-sized pieces - 2 lbs</strong></li>
        <li> <strong>Onion, finely chopped - 1</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>Garlic cloves, minced - 3 to 4</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>Medium-sized tomatoes, diced - 3 to 4</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>Okras, stems removed and chopped diagonally - 8 pieces</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>Spinach (you can substitute kale, sweet potato leaves, collard greens or cassava leaves) - 1 lb</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>Red palm oil - Â¼ cup</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>Eggplant, diced into cubes - 1 cup</strong> </li>
        <li> <strong>Pepper - to taste</strong> </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Before preparing the ingredients, place the codfish into a bowl and season with salt and lemon juice on each piece. Set it aside to marinate for 20 to 30 minutes and prepare everything else.</li>
        <li>In a pot, heat the palm oil on a medium-high flame. When ready, saute the garlic and onions for a few minutes until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the eggplant, tomato, okra, bell pepper, and bay leaf into the pot. Saute them for a few minutes until everything is nicely incorporated.</li>
        <li>When done, add the spinach or green leaves you have into the pot and give it a gentle stir to mix everything. Then, add a cup of water (or you can also use vegetable broth) onto the pot.</li>
        <li>Add in the marinated fish with the other ingredients, like making stew or soup. You can also start layering the fish first before the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Once the fish is added, cover the pot, then lower the heat. Let the calulu cook for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 15 to 20 minutes, lower the heat until the stew only simmers. Uncover the pot then give it a stir.</li>
        <li>If you want a thicker consistency, add the arrowroot or flour to the mixture. Mix it and cook the calulu again for another 5 minutes until the soup thickens.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, then serve the calulu on a plate or bowl. Serve it with rice if preferred, then enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
